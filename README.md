# UFOs

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to create an interactive site. This site will be for users who are interested in UFO sightings. They will be able to see an entire list of sightings with details such as when, where, how long, and general comments from those who witnessed it. If the user needs to narrow down their search, they will be able to filter the list to specific sightings they may want information on. 

## Results
The filter option is located on the left side of the website. Users will be able to filter their search based on date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO spotted. Although there are 5 filters, the user is not required to use all of them.  If the user does not want to filter their search, then the table of all the sightings will be shown.
