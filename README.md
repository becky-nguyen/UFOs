# UFOs

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to create an interactive site. This site will be for users who are interested in UFO sightings. They will be able to see an entire list of sightings with details such as when, where, how long, and general comments from those who witnessed it. If the user needs to narrow down their search, they will be able to filter the list to specific sightings they may want information on. 

## Results
The filter option is located on the left side of the website. Users will be able to filter their search based on date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO spotted. Although there are 5 filters, the user is not required to use all of them.  If the user does not want to filter their search, then the table of all the sightings will be shown.

### Examples 
To filter the table to just Oregon UFO sightings, type "or" into the Enter State field. The table will automatically populate to those values.

To filter the table to UFO sightings in Oregon and on January 1, type it in as shown below.

It's not required, but you can use up to all 5 filters for an extremely exact search.

Some important things to note is that the text users type in must be exact. Best practice would be to scroll through some of the full table to get an understanding of what types of things you may search for. Below are some rules for the users to follow. 
* Date must be in the exact same m(m)/d(d)/yyyy format. Example: January 1, 2010 must be typed as 1/1/2010 and not 01/01/2010
* Cities are all lowercase
* States are abbreviated and lowercase
* United States must be abbreviated and lowercase
* Shapes are based on what the witness interpret it as and can be quite abstract (one person saw a cigar, another saw a cylinder)

To go back to the full table, remove any text you may have put into the fields and click outside of the text fields for the page to refresh. Users may also just refresh the page itself. 

## Summary
One drawback of this design is how limited the search functions are; users must be exact with the syntax of their searches, or else the filter will not catch it. There should be an overall field text, that allows the user to search for any keywords within the entire row. Additionally, the country column is repetitive. All of the entries in the table are from the US, so it could confuse the user and make them think there are other countries within the table. It would be better to just get rid of that column and specify on the site that all of the sightings are within the US.
